  <article class="about-body">
    <p>
      FareShare makes it simple to track and split costs between friends, family, or teammates —
      no spreadsheets, no stress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re planning a weekend getaway, organizing a group dinner, or managing ongoing shared
      expenses, FareShare keeps everything clear and fair. Each trip (called a <em>Share</em>) brings
      everyone together to record and review expenses (<em>Fares</em>), track who paid for what, and
      instantly see who owes or is owed.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We built FareShare to make group spending transparent and effortless. We know how quickly shared
      costs can become confusing — especially during travel or events. With FareShare, you can focus on
      the moments that matter, while we handle the math in the background.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a <strong>Share</strong> for any trip or activity</li>
      <li>Add participants and log shared <strong>Fares</strong></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Why “FareShare”?</h2>
    <p>
      Because everyone deserves a fair share — and it just so happens to rhyme.
